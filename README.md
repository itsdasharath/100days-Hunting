# 100 Days of Bug Bounty Hunting ðŸš€

Welcome to my journey of learning bug bounty hunting!  
For the next 100 days, I will be documenting what I learn each day in a separate Markdown file.  
Each file will cover a specific topic or vulnerability I explored that day.

## ðŸ“… Daily Notes

Below is the list of all days with links to their respective notes:

- [Day 1 - Topic Name](./Day01.md)
- [Day 2 - Topic Name](./Day02.md)
- [Day 3 - Topic Name](./Day03.md)
<!-- Add more days as you progress -->

Stay tuned for daily updates!
