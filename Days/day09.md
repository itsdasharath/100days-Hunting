## 🗓️ Bug Bounty Hunting – Day 9

Today’s focus was purely on **enumeration** and target understanding.

I spent the entire day mapping out the application structure, trying to uncover hidden or undocumented endpoints that could lead to potential vulnerabilities. This included reviewing available documentation in detail and cross-referencing it with my recon results to identify possible gaps or overlooked functionality.

The aim was to gain a complete picture of how the application works before diving deeper into testing specific features.

### 🧠 Reflection

No bugs found today, but I significantly improved my understanding of the target’s architecture and potential attack surface. This groundwork will speed up testing and increase efficiency in the coming days.
