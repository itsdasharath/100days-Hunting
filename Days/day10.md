## 🗓️ Bug Bounty Hunting – Day 10

Today was lighter due to **Raksha Bandhan** celebrations.  
Still, I managed to spend a short amount of time on **tech stack enumeration** and refining my understanding of the target application.

This small effort helped reinforce what I’ve learned so far and kept the streak alive.
